# Testing @ Linode

Hello Linode candidate! We are constantly looking for the best people and we've found, for test engineers, the usual rigid technical aptitude tests are not indicative of a candidate's success in the role. Instead, we've come up with a small project that will allow you to more freely demonstrate your abilities as a test engineer.

# The Challenge

Weather -- it's all the rage these days. Kids, teenagers, adults and even old folks are finding themselves checking it out. At Linode we care about the CLOUD, and we've discovered that, occassionally,
weather apps aren't entirely reliable. We think they are in dire need of TESTING!

# Instructions 

* In a programming language of your choice, setup an automated browser testing framework (Webdriver-based preferably) and write a suite of tests for the [Dark Sky web application](https://forecast.io). Think about how you might increase test coverage for this framework, while minimizing maintenance costs.

* Try not to spend more than 2 hours on this challenge, and do not publish it to public Github.

* You **must** provide a dockerfile, script or written instructions on how to run your test suite.

* The test suite **must** be executable on **mac** & **pc**

* When you have completed the challenge, Submit your project in a zip file attachment to kwilson@linode.com.
